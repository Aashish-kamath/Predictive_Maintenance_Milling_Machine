## 📌 Overview

Predictive maintenance is a proactive approach that leverages data-driven models to forecast equipment failures **before** they happen. In this project, we apply machine learning algorithms to monitor CNC milling machine data and accurately predict component failures.

This solution enables:
- 🛡️ Reduced unexpected downtimes
- ⚙️ Optimized maintenance schedules
- 💸 Cost savings in industrial operations
